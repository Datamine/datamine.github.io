    Abstract
</atitle>
<br><br>
<p>
    I propose that people possess <i>implicit currencies</i>, such as data, social capital, 
    time, and attention. Abstractly, most online monetization strategies are conversions 
    of aggregated micropayments in these implicit currencies into  dollars. Because these 
    conversion processes are extremely lossy, I propose that people's implicit currencies are 
    critically undervalued. This poses two threats: firstly, from a consumer-protection standpoint, 
    users never know what they're giving up, and are structurally positioned to be exploited. 
    Secondly, it is unclear how feasible such monetization 
    strategies will be as users expend their implicit currencies, potentially leaving them unable to 
    access products that are currently considered  both "free" and "essential".

    Implicit Currencies: Commerce Without Dollars
</atitle>
<br><br>
<p>
    The advertising industry has largely enabled the Internet as we know it: the 
    vast majority of sites you might use are <i>free</i>, with no barriers to access. 
    In the early days of the Internet, monetization was simple: on your site, you 
    might display some ads related to the content, and hope that some users click 
    on them. The advertiser might pay you a flat rate for hosting the ad, or per 
    ad click. We've come a long way since then. Ads are now displayed and priced 
    dynamically. Data that advertisers have on you is used to decide which ads 
    to show, subject to a bidding process governed by high-frequency exchanges.<small><sup><a href="#footnote0" name="note0">[0]</a></sup></small> 
    The market is cornered by Google and Facebook, who receive 73% of all online 
    advertising revenue in the US, and capture about 99% of the growth in this 
    market.<small><sup><a href="#footnote1" name="note1">[1]</a></sup></small> The 
    game is now fundamentally about <i>data</i>: advertisers seek to build 
    ever more accurate profiles of users, so that in the future, they may be 
    shown ads they're more likely to click on.
</p>
<p>
    Thus, the objective of many sites is now to capture user data: the data that 
    you generate or expose by browsing the Internet. Examples includes your browsing 
    history, gender, GPS coordinates at a point in time, Facebook pictures, the 
    identities of your friends, tweets, ads you've clicked on, etc. As such, I 
    propose that users possess <i>data</i> as an <i>implicit currency</i>. Let's define an 
    implicit currency by the following characteristics:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        It's an abstract thing that people have, not a financial instrument 
        in the traditional sense, i.e. unlike US dollars, Swiss Francs, bitcoin, 
        gold futures, etc. 
    </li>
    <li>
        It has extremely low transactional costs and is available in extremely 
        small units, thereby lending itself well to micropayments.<small><sup><a href="#footnote2" name="note2">[2]</a></sup></small>
    </li>
    <li>
        It can be aggregated by any party, and converted into a traditional 
        currency, like US dollars.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    It is easy to see how user data is an implicit currency: everyone has it and 
    generates more all the time. The transactional costs are minimal &mdash; it's a 
    trivial data transfer, and any datapoint, no matter how small, is valuable 
    because it assists in crafting a better profile of the user. Additionally, 
    the economic value of the data increases in the amount of the data: the larger 
    the dataset, the better models it yields. Most importantly, this data can be 
    quite directly turned into dollars. Examples include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Crafting better user profiles to better target ads, thereby increasing advertiser revenues.
    </li>
    <li>
        User behavior data can be used to optimize flows within websites and create 
        user experiences most likely to induce purchases or perpetuate high user engagement.
    </li>
    <li>
        User-provided data (e.g. labelled images, sounds, GPS data, etc.) can be 
        used to train machine learning models, which can then be turned into profitable, 
        standalone products &mdash; e.g. voice transcription services, image identification, 
        machine translation, etc. It's worth expanding on this point: the central
        thesis at Google and many other leading tech companies is that AI will 
        change <i>everything</i> in the next few decades. They're rushing to build weak 
        AI in every conceivable domain, and users are providing them with the 
        data to get the job done. The potential economic value is enormous.
    </li>
</ul>
<img class='imgcenter' src='https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/self_driving.png'/>
<p>
    What's critically important is that these conversion processes are generally 
    lossy (inefficient). For example, the advertisement industry &mdash; which pays 
    for user data en masse &mdash; has a significant amount of inefficiency that is 
    priced into the product. Plenty of consumers are unreachable due to ad blockers. 
    Bots accounted for 7.2 billion dollars in ads fraud last year.<small><sup><a href="#footnote3" name="note3">[3]</a></sup></small> 
    In June 2017, 
    Procter &amp; Gamble cut $140 million from its advertising budget, and saw no 
    impact on sales.<small><sup><a href="#footnote4" name="note4">[4]</a></sup></small> 
    The implication is simple and important: if this process 
    turns data in dollars in an inefficient fashion, then the data put into the 
    process must be worth more than the dollar output. Thus, the consumer is 
    likely to be <i>vastly overpaying</i> with their data for any "free" product.
</p>
<p>
    This raises a few issues. First off, it's hard to pin-point the monetary
    value of types of user data, and even if you could, they're probably in 
    perpetual flux. So, even if you wanted to trade some of your data for access 
    to a website, it's hard to know what a "fair" trade would be.<small><sup><a href="#footnote5" name="note5">[5]</a></sup></small>
</p>
<p>
    <i>Secondly, you never know how wealthy or poor you are in terms of user data.</i>
    It's clear that some kinds of data, like your credit card records, are much 
    more valuable than others, like your tumblr history.  And a company only needs 
    to obtain your data once in order to store it &mdash; if some advertiser already 
    knows that you like cheeseburgers, it's not valuable if you supply that data 
    again. So the question is: what does that advertiser already know about you? 
    Have you already given up the really valuable data? And of course you have 
    no idea, because these transactions are implicit. You go to a website, and 
    a tracking cookie adds that visit to your user profile. You might sign up 
    with your email, and the site might sell your email address to a data broker. 
    You don't get a receipt for any of this. It's like trying to manage a bank 
    account and never being allowed to look at the balance.
</p>
<p>
    Granted, not knowing your "data balance" is currently not a concern to anyone. 
    But it's likely to be a concern in the future. Currently, the advertising 
    markets are very inefficient and still making money hand over fist, so there's 
    a lot of space for waste. But these markets will gradually become more efficient, 
    the margins thinner, and companies will have to economize more carefully. 
</p>
<p>
    This could have unpleasant &mdash; but economically entirely plausible &mdash; effects 
    that consumers are currently not expecting. Websites that are currently "free" 
    for you to use are generally making money off you by showing you ads, which 
    you might click on every once in a while, or by selling your data. Suppose 
    there's such a site that sells your user data to some advertiser. What would 
    happen if the advertiser were to conclude that you'll never click on any ads? 
    <i>What if the advertiser already knows everything they want to know about you?</i>
    What if you have no further useful data to offer to the advertiser, and 
    they'll only want a bit of data from you in a few weeks, to update their models? 
    In all of these cases, it is entirely rational for the advertiser not to pay 
    that site for <i>your</i> data. In turn, it is entirely rational for that site to 
    cease letting you waste their bandwidth &mdash; and thus you're locked out.
</p>
<p>
    My great fear is that as the data/advertising markets inevitably become more 
    efficient, consumers will find out, to their horror, that all these "free" 
    online products were never free, that they've unwittingly been paying with 
    their data all along, that they have actually been ripped off for years, and 
    after they've been milked for all they're worth, they're data-poor and those 
    "free" products are then completely inaccessible (unless they're willing to 
    pay in some other way). 
</p>
<p>
    In what other ways might users pay for online products? Actual currencies, 
    like USD or Zcash are certainly options. The <a href='https://basicattentiontoken.org/'>Basic Attention Token</a>, courtesy 
    of the <a href='https://brave.com/'>Brave</a> project, offers a way to monetize online content with micropayments. 
    However, it's hard to get people to pay for stuff with real money when they're 
    used to not doing so. There are other potential implicit currencies. Among 
    them, social capital currently looks most compelling. You may have seen 
    paywalls for online content/products that deal in social capital:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        "You can view this video after you share this link on Facebook..."
    </li>
    <li>
        "To access this content, please re-tweet this tweet..."
    </li>
    <li>
        "To access this content, at least three people need to click this referral link:..."
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These are presently rare, but the advertising potential is clear: word-of-mouth 
    is powerful &mdash; people will always trust their friends & social media circles 
    more than ads displayed in sidebars.<small><sup><a href="#footnote6" name="note6">[6]</a></sup></small> 
    It follows that advertisers could powerfully 
    leverage your social capital. The tricky thing with social capital &mdash; just 
    as with data &mdash; is that you expend it, and rarely do you know how wealthy 
    or poor you are in terms of social capital. 
</p>
<p>
    Just as with user data, there's a dystopian scenario to bring the point home: 
    imagine that instead of paying for Netflix with dollars, you have "free" 
    access because you post every TV episode you watch as a status update on 
    Facebook. But eventually, you've posted so often that none of your friends 
    click the links anymore, so it's no longer effective advertising for Netflix. 
    In turn, it doesn't make sense for Netflix to pay for your bandwidth, 
    and you're locked out. This would suck, in itself, but 
    especially so given that you've <i>expended your social capital</i> &mdash; your friends 
    have muted you on Facebook &mdash; to save a few dollars a month, a 
    disastrous consequence that was not obvious to anticipate.
</p>
<p>
    Cases can be made for other forms of implicit currency in which you might 
    pay for access. For example, you've probably solved CAPTCHAs. Most of these 
    involve you typing out a messily written word, or clicking on all the images 
    containing some object. What's happening here is that you're training a machine 
    learning model that recognizes words or labels images, respectively. This is 
    almost like traditional work: you're making a micropayment in a combination 
    of your time, labor, and knowledge. Possibly, all of these are implicit 
    currencies.<small><sup><a href="#footnote7" name="note7">[7]</a></sup></small>
</p>
<p>
    Thus, I believe that as the advertising industry matures, the biggest questions 
    in tech are going to center around how to monetize products by means other than ads:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        What are people's implicit currencies?
    </li>
    <li>
        How do we convert these implicit currencies into dollars?
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    In particular, I expect that the biggest theme of the advertising industry 
    over the next few years is going to be about capitalizing on people's social 
    capital. Everyone has it, and it's enormously valuable for advertisers. To 
    some extent, Instagram &mdash; which, as a platform, is all about displaying social 
    capital &mdash; might be the first real entrant in this market: so-called "Instagram 
    influencers" make a great deal of money by partnering with 
    advertisers.<small><sup><a href="#footnote8" name="note8">[8]</a></sup></small> I 
    anticipate an extremely lucrative future for the companies leading the market 
    in capturing social capital and other new forms of implicit currency.
</p>
<p>
    This leaves one important question, which is how to protect the consumer in 
    this regard. Implicit currencies make it extremely hard for their possessors 
    to ever know how much they have, how relatively wealthy or poor they are, and 
    the nature of these implicit transactions leaves the consumer with no idea 
    how much they're paying, if they're even aware that they're making transactions 
    at all. Moreover, notions like "personal data" or "social capital" and the 
    expenditure thereof are abstractions that are likely difficult for many 
    consumers to reason about, leaving them wide-open to being hyperbolically short-changed.
</p>
<p>
    In the long run, this is a consumer-protection nightmare, and also seriously 
    calls into question how feasible this economic model is for creating social 
    good. If users unsustainably over-expend in the various implicit currencies, 
    then they may not be able to pay for services and products that everyone 
    presently considers both "free" and "essential", like social networking or Internet search. 
</p>
<p>
    However, there's something of a silver lining on the horizon: implicit currencies 
    seem to restore over time. Even if you expend all your social capital, you'll 
    gain more over time just in the regular course of living your life, and even 
    if you expend all your user data at one point, you'll generate more shortly. 
    Regardless, this does not solve the practical problem of implicit currencies 
    being hard for their users to value, and the ethical problem of the user being
    taken advantage of in this respect. I strongly hope that advances in 
    micropayments &mdash; whether in fiat or crypto &mdash; will give users more 
    fair<small><sup><a href="#footnote9" name="note9">[9]</a></sup></small> and transparent choices for accessing online content 
    without abstractly bankrupting themselves.

    Chicago economists might derisively sneer at the notion of a "fair" price and argue that the only meaningful concept here is a market-clearing price, i.e. economic equilibrium. 
    I disagree &mdash; my intuition is that the market-clearing price in this domain likely imposes significant negative externalities on the public, but that is out of scope for this article.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="#note6" name="footnote6">[6]</a>
    In fact, people will trust their friends and social media circles more than 
    just about any other news source, which led to the proliferation of "fake 
    news" that spread on social media in recent years.

    There certainly is a case to be made for time, since it is the scarcest economic 
    resource &mdash; one of my favorite adages is that money is nothing but a 
    measurement of one's ability to harness other people's time.
