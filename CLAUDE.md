# CLAUDE.md - Helper Notes

## INSTRUCTIONS
There are only two files you may look at: `index.html` and `new.css`. Everything else is irrelevant.
Only ever consult these two files.

This is a static html/css website. You may import other javascript/css packages as needed, but this will never be served dynamically.
