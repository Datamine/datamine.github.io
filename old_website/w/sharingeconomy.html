    Sharing Economy: Big Shifts, Big Problems
</atitle>
<br><br>

<p>
    The Sharing Economy is broad in scope: it includes companies like AirBnB, Uber, and TaskRabbit, all of which are
    subtly different. Someone renting out their apartment on AirBnB is essentially trading temporary access to their
    property for money.  Someone driving an Uber is trading temporary access to their property (their car) and labor (driving)
    for money. A person running a few errands on TaskRabbit is purely trading their labor for money. In this article, we will
    focus on the part of the sharing economy that allows people to trade their labor for money, and the problems it presents.
</p>
<p>
    Currently, in the vast majority of cases, a person that uses the sharing economy to make money is not an employee,
    but an independent contractor. That's the point, at least in theory: to let people with spare time make a bit of
    supplemental income by giving a stranger a ride, or by running a small errand. A company like Uber or Handy purports
    to be simply a service that connects clients with contractors, with as little paperwork and as few strings attached as possible.
</p>
<p>
    This wouldn't give rise to any concerns if contractors used the sharing economy only for supplemental income.
    But of course that is not the case: most of the Uber- or Lyft-drivers you meet drive full-time. There is a
    pronounced trend of traditional service jobs gradually moving into the domain of the sharing economy.
</p>
<p>
    This trend is certain for a simple pricing reason: service providers from the sharing economy can massively undercut traditional service providers
    because independent contractors are not required to receive the minimum wage. For example, take a traditional cleaning company: they have to pay
    all their employees at least the minimum wage, which sets a limit on how low they can make the prices they charge, while still turning a profit.
    Now take a sharing economy-based cleaning &ldquo;company&rdquo;: they don't have any wages to pay their cleaners. They make a profit by taking a
    cut of what their contractors make. The contractor sets their own wage (or may be required by the company to set a particular wage), and wanting
    to find work, will necessarily set their wage so as to undercut the prices of their competition (note that competition may hail from both the traditional
    and the sharing economy). This has two likely outcomes:
    <ol>
        <li>
            The contractor may earn a wage (consistently) below the federal minimum, since many of these jobs were priced at or near the minimum wage to begin with.
        </li>
        <li>
            The traditional service provider may be outcompeted by sharing economy-based service providers.
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    The conclusion of all this is simple: a substantial share of the participants in the
    labor economy will transition into being independent contractors full-time, as the
    traditional companies that would otherwise have employed them will not be able to
    compete as effectively. It is to be expected that wages for such contractors would
    be lower than they are now, whereby many of these workers will be earning below the
    minimum wage. However, as the market moves toward
    the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0b/Wage_labour.jpg">new equilibrium wage</a>, more
    people should be able to find work. That is important, and it is a fundamental part of the reason why
    the mainstream economic opinion is that the minimum wage is not economically helpful, and that we might be
    better off without it. Moreover, given the complex and large-scale impacts of this shift in wage distribution,
    it is not immediately clear (to me) whether this shift in wages is, overall, a good or a bad thing.
</p>
<p>
    What's much more concerning is the fact that the independent contractors of the sharing economy will not have
    the protection and benefits that employees have. Over the years, employees have accrued domain-specific protections,
    insurance, retirement plans, trade unions, automatic handling of certain tax obligations, etc. Being an
    employee &mdash; <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/ebs2.pdf">even a minimally paid one</a> &mdash; endows a
    laborer with a number of valuable privileges, ranging from personal benefits to political/institutional bargaining power.
    Independent contractors, by and large, don't get these. This is one of the big problems with the shift into the sharing
    economy: the people who most need employment benefits and legal protection from exploitation stand to lose both.
</p>
<p>
    The other big problem is that there is no fast and clear solution to that problem. Historically, we have created not
    only legal distinctions between different types of employment, but also norms and expectations around them, which play
    into the nature of these legal distinctions. Now that these norms and expectations are being subverted and there's a
    new &lsquo;type&rsquo; of independent contractor (i.e. the sharing economy's quasi-employee) that is technically hard
    to distinguish from traditional independent contractors, it's not obvious at all how to how to endow the contractors
    of the sharing economy with the protections and benefits they need without also equivalently endowing traditional
    independent contractors and upsetting the balance of incentives between employee- and contractor-status.
</p>
<p>
    Some courts have made legal decisions that turn the
    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/18/business/uber-contests-california-labor-ruling-that-says-drivers-should-be-employees.html">quasi-employee into an actual employee</a>.
    However, it seems unlikely that courts will have the time to examine every single business in the sharing economy and to pass judgment on the status of
    their workers. Beyond that, for such legislation to be truly impactful, it needs to be in effect across the entire United States, which will
    probably take many years even for a single company, not to mention any type of blanket decision.
</p>
<p>
    In conclusion: the rise of the sharing economy already has, and will continue to replace traditional employee-positions
    with contractor-positions in the service economy. This will almost certainly lead to a circumvention of the minimum
    wage, which will marginally lower unemployment. Those who were previously unemployed but find work in the sharing
    economy will probably be marginally better off. However, those who were previously employed and are forced to transition
    into contractor-positions because traditionally-employing firms are outcompeted at a price level will be worse off:
    they can be expected to lose significantly from their hourly wage, and they will lose valuable employment protections and benefits.
</p>
<p>
    It is unclear how to ensure that the quality-of-life for the previously employed group does not
    slip significantly: the speed of the judicial process is slow, and it is not obvious how to divide
    the sharing economy's quasi-employees from regular independent contractors, so the quasi-employees
    can be awarded the protection and benefits they deserve. Beyond that, even if such protections and
    benefits were awarded, it's not clear how they could be awarded without the cost of them implicitly
    coming out of the paycheck of the contractor: if the costs of these benefits and protections are forced
    on the contracting entity, then this may further lower the wages of the contractors &mdash; so should
    independent contractors also have a minimum wage? Should the government pay for contractor benefits
    and protections? Whatever the solution, it will be controversial.
</p>
<p>
    But it is not even certain whether a &lsquo;solution&rsquo; is necessary! It is not clear at all whether securing
    benefits and protections for the contractors of the sharing economy will be, in aggregate, socially and economically
    beneficial. To me, it certainly <em>feels right</em> to try to secure benefits and protections for these
    contractors &mdash; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_the_United_States">socioeconomic inequality is a serious issue</a>, and I
    believe that the floor on the standard of living should be significantly
    raised<small><sup><a href="#footnote0" name="note0">[0]</a></sup></small> &mdash; but admittedly, it is hard
    to predict the indirect effects of legislative action to that effect. There are many examples of legislation enacted to
    improve the standard of living that ended up lowering it via unforeseen consequences.
</p>
<p>
    It's a tough nut to crack, especially because it's difficult to gauge the number and types of jobs that
    will move into the sharing economy, and the speed with which this will happen. Thus, armed with little
    reliable data, it's hard to predict resulting situations and solve the problems outlined above. The
    only real certainty is that the move will have far-reaching socioeconomic impacts. It is difficult
    to forecast how these impacts will be manifest, and consequently, to decide how to prepare for these impacts.
