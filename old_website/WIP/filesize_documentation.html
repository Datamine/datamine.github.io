	<p>
	This is a filesize analysis tool developed for UNIX-based operating systems. It may also work on Windows with some reduced functionality. It outputs helpful statistical visualizations about any path (folder) that you choose to run the script on. The visualizations include:
	<ul>
	<li>
	A bar chart that displays the number of files in your path, in categories according to their sizes.
	</li>
	<li>
	A pie chart that shows the total space occupied by differently sized files.</li>
	</ul>
	To use the tool, you must have Python and its standard libraries installed. You must also have the <code>numpy</code> and <code>matplotlib</code> libraries installed. This tool was developed using Python 2.7.4 and Matplotlib 1.2.1.</p>
	<p>
	Using the script is simple: download it, open up your terminal, and type:
	</p>
	<span style="display:inline-block; width:100%; text-align:center;"><code>python filesize.py &lt;your path here&gt; &lt;hidden&gt; &lt;save&gt;</code></span>
	<p>
	In the <code>&lt;your path here&gt;</code> field, enter the path that you would like to run the script on: for example, <code>/home/documents</code>. For the next option, <code>&lt;hidden&gt;</code>, enter <code>y</code> if you would like hidden files to be ignored be the script, and <code>n</code> otherwise. This tool currently does not filter out all hidden files on Windows, since it goes by the UNIX-convention of hidden files being characterized by a dot at the beginning of their filenames. For the last option, <code>&lt;save&gt;</code>, enter <code>y</code> if you would like the charts output by the script to be saved, and <code>n</code> otherwise. Here is an example use of the script:
	</p>
	<span style="display:inline-block; width:100%; text-align:center;"><code>python filesize.py ~/me/Documents/ y y</code></span>
	<p>Here is an example output of the script:</p>

	<div class="imghelper">
		<img width="395px" src="../images/barchart.png"></img>
		<img width="340px" src="../images/piechart.png"></img>
	</div>
	<p>
	The bar chart is quite intuitive. It simply shows how many files there are in each filesize category. There are 100 categories, and they are evenly spaced between the smallest and largest file in the path. In this example, the smallest file has size 0 kB, the largest file has size 2,000,000 kB. So the categories are on intervals of 20,000 kB. You know how to read a bar chart. The only thing that is a little tricky here is the scale on the y-axis: because you're quite likely to have tens of thousands of tiny files (especially in the root/system files), and you're not so likely to have many large files, the y-axis is, for all y&gt;1, on a base-10 logarithmic scale. A (&ldquo;normal&rdquo;) linear scale would make the bars representing the smaller counts almost meaninglessly small. However, the scale is linear between 0 and 1: a true logarithmic scale has its origin at (0,1) rather than (0,0), and we want to be able to differentiate between counts of zero and one of certain filesizes.
	</p>
	<p>
	The pie chart is less intutive, but more useful. Referring to the example: the title of the legend reads "Total Size: 29.5983 GB". This is the total size of all files in the path you have called the script on, excluding hidden files if you used that option. The colored slices of the pie each represent the percentage of those 29.5983 GB that is occupied by a particular size-tier of files. This becomes clearer by example: look at the big, lime-green slice of the pie. It reads 27.91%. This means that the files represented by that lime-green wedge take up 27.91% of the 29.5983 GB. Indeed, if you refer to the legend, you see that lime-green denotes files of size 1 GB to 10 GB. There are six of them, and altogether they occupy 8.2597 GB of space. This is 27.91% of the 29.5983 GB. The same goes for the blue wedge which represents the 100 MB to 1 GB filesize category, etc.
	</p>
	<p>
	If you entered <code>y</code> for the <code>&lt;save&gt;</code> option, then the charts that are output by the tool will be saved to the location from which you ran the tool. (If you are uncertain of your location in your filesystem, use the <code>pwd</code> command after running <code>filesize.py</code> to see where your image will be saved.) This is useful for users with small monitors, as the output charts can be quite large, and Python's Matplotlib display windows are occasionally somewhat difficult to interact with. You will find the files titled <code>filesize_barchart_&lt;timestamp&gt;.png</code> and <code>filesize_piechart_&lt;timestamp&gt; .png</code>. The <code>&lt;timestamp&gt;</code> will be automatically replaced by a timestamp in UNIX Time to create uniquely titled files, whereby to prevent the user from accidentally overwriting their charts when using the tool multiple times.</p>

	<sh>Issues</sh>
		<p>
	There is one known serious bug: the program fails on certain system files. In particular, calling <code>filesize.py</code> on paths including the files <code>/dev/core</code> and  <code>/proc/kcore</code> yields nonsensical results, because <code>/dev,/sys,/run,/proc</code> include system files that are not conventional files, but rather are device- and kernel-related in such a way that attempting to call their filesize outputs nonsensically large numbers. This is a bug that is specific to Linux-machines. It is likely that there are analogous bugs with regard to system files on machines running different operating systems. In conclusion, this means that running the script on the root directory (<code>/</code>) yields partially meaningless results. It is suggested to run the script on other directories, or to edit the code (in <code>main()</code>, lines 177-197) to filter out readings from specific problematic files. On lines 192 and 193, I have placed and commented out a small piece of code that discards filesize readings of size greater than 100 GB. You can uncomment this to activate this functionality, and edit it to change the threshold as you like. This is a reasonably effective, but naive solution (it would be better to have some way to ignore certain non-conventional files).
	</p>
	<p>There is also an issue with the pie chart that you may see in the example above: for extremely small wedges, their percentage-texts may overlap. Currently, this is a tragedy that I am willing to accept. I can envision potential solutions, but they are all quite involved &mdash; this problem is not sufficiently egregious to merit solving at this time.</p>
