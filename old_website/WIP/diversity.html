    Diversity in Tech is Necessary for Democracy
</atitle>
<br><br>
<p>
    Tech companies are, by and large, not particularly diverse. 
    The stereotypical image of Silicon Valley is one of white, male, twenty-somethings 
    in company-branded hoodies, and that&rsquo;s not far from reality. 
    Men hold three quarters of tech jobs.<small><sup><a href="#footnote0" name="note0">[0]</a></sup></small> 
    Activists perpetually advocate for more diversity: for women and ethnic minorities to be better-represented 
    in this industry, and for the paths that lead into tech to be made more accessible to everyone. 
</p>
<p>
    However, there exist people who are not at all on board with diversity efforts 
    (and who, unsurprisingly, are often advantaged by the status quo). 
    This issue re-surfaces every few months, with the most recent big stir following 
    James Damore publishing a document<small><sup><a href="#footnote1" name="note1">[1]</a></sup></small> 
    railing against diversity efforts at Google. 
    The anti-diversity crowd usually attacks with demographic questions about interest 
    or ability in science &amp; technology, or questions of fairness in giving particular groups a leg up. 
    Although I consider these debates largely settled in favor of diversity, 
    I believe that a very important axis has been omitted from the discourse thus far.
</p>
<p>
    I&rsquo;d like to argue for diversity because it seems necessary for a functioning democracy. 
    Consider the colossal <i>power</i> that our tech giants wield.  
    Companies like Alphabet (Google) and Facebook are comparable to nation-states in the impact that 
    they have on people&rsquo;s lives and on our global economy. 
    At this point, Facebook has 1.2 billion daily active users.<small><sup><a href="#footnote2" name="note2">[2]</a></sup></small> 
    One experimental study run by Facebook showed the ease by which it can alter the emotions of hundreds of thousands 
    of its users.<small><sup><a href="#footnote3" name="note3">[3]</a></sup></small> Apple has a $260 billion cash hoard, 
    comparable to the largest sovereign wealth funds. I am certain that there are many <i>countries</i> that could fail and 
    fall into civil war, and yet have less of an impact on global markets and supply chains than a prolonged Google outage. 
    Denmark has recently appointed an <i>ambassador</i> to the largest tech 
    companies,<small><sup><a href="#footnote4" name="note4">[4]</a></sup></small> and you can expect to see more of those.
</p>
<p>
    In aggregate, tech giants have quasi-monopolistic control of digital infrastructures that underpin both 
    our personal lives and national economies. And despite their critical importance, they&rsquo;re not really accountable to 
    anyone.<small><sup><a href="#footnote5" name="note5">[5]</a></sup></small> Tech 
    companies are essentially ivory towers, employing a tiny sliver of the population. 
    To most people (<i>almost everyone</i>), the inner workings of tech companies are unknowable, their products 
    indistinguishable from magic. Tech workers, elected purely by the free market, constitute a tiny 
    group wielding great power in our society.
</p>
<p>
    This power dynamic may be vaguely offensive to notions of democracy in its own right, 
    but it&rsquo;s especially concerning when you consider the demographics of these tech companies. 
    If you accept the premise that these companies wield levels of power comparable with the largest 
    political institutions, then, for democratic nations, it follows that representation within those
    companies should abide by democratic principles.<small><sup><a href="#footnote6" name="note6">[6]</a></sup></small> 
    Conversely, it seems weirdly undemocratic that 
    these central levers of power should be controlled by a small, culturally homogeneous group of 
    men.<small><sup><a href="#footnote7" name="note7">[7]</a></sup></small>
    More subtly, regardless of whether or not this is technically undemocratic in some denotative sense, 
    this situation may feel undemocratic to those who are outside of tech and feel unrepresented, to whom 
    the tech companies of Silicon Valley are as powerful and inaccessible as a medieval king to a serf. 
    Such a collective feeling, of course, undermines faith and participation in our democratic system.
</p>
<p>
    Thus, there is a simple, four-point argument for working toward diversity in tech:
    <ol>
        <li> Tech companies have far-reaching impacts on all members of society.</li>
        <li> Tech companies currently employ a generally small and homogeneous subset of society.</li>
        <li> Consequently, there is the danger that tech companies may adversely affect people who are 
        not represented, i.e. employed by, those tech companies, or that the unrepresented will feel politically alienated.</li>
        <li> Assuming that employees act in the best interests of themselves and their social groups, increasing diversity 
        among employees should decrease the danger outlined above, and should contribute to technology being a force for 
        social good, to products benefiting all rather than a select few at the expense of others.</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    I believe that as the growth of technology accelerates, and as our lives become perpetually more 
    dependent on technological products, questions of control over these digital infrastructures 
    become political questions, perhaps too important to be relegated to the invisible hand of the 
    market. I believe in answering political questions democratically, and diversity as a proxy 
    for democratic representation seems like a necessary first step.
</p>
<p>
    This leaves one important detail, a question about what kinds of diversity to accommodate. 
    The anti-diversity crowd frequently alleges that tech as a sector is overwhelmingly liberal, and 
    that conservative opinions are sidelined. They argue that if the tech sector is going to strive to be diverse, 
    then &ldquo;viewpoint diversity&rdquo; should be respected, too: that tech should be more representative of different 
    political persuasions just as it should be more representative of different genders, ethnicities, etc. 
    This creates a difficult question: what do we do about viewpoints that oppose diversity? 
    Do we, in the name of viewpoint diversity, include them? 
    This seems analogous to the 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance">paradox of tolerance</a>, 
    which Karl Popper succinctly addressed: a tolerant society 
    should not tolerate intolerance. Analogously, a diverse society should not permit discrimination in the guise of viewpoint diversity.

	Furthermore, note that &ldquo;tech jobs&rdquo; casts a wide net. Tracy Chou found that

    <a href="#note5" name="footnote5">[5]</a> They may be publicly traded, but public shareholders in Alphabet, Facebook, etc. largely don&rsquo;t have voting rights.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="#note6" name="footnote6">[6]</a> I grant that the notion of &ldquo;democratic representation&rdquo; is tricky 
    when you&rsquo;re talking about companies for which hiring practices are financial decisions. 
    I fear that there exists a market externality in that ensuring democratic representation among the workforce may 
    not be commensurate with maximizing shareholder value, which is what publicly traded companies have traditionally been obliged to do.

<p>
    <a href="#note7" name="footnote7">[7]</a> Note that there are actual branches of government about which similar complaints could be made.
