    Adventures in Deleting Tweets
</atitle>
<br><br>

<p>
    I am a frequent user of <a href='https://twitter.com/@johnloeber'>Twitter</a>,
    a platform that I generally characterize
    as the perfect place to share thoughts that are too good to let slip by,
    but not good enough to actively tell my friends. Because my tweets
    are just transient thoughts, they vary in the extent to which
    they represent my current views after time has passed. Thus, I like to periodically
    clear the slate, and delete all my tweets and likes. For that purpose, I wrote
    <a href='https://github.com/Datamine/Archive-Tweets'>Archive-Tweets</a>, a toolkit
    for downloading and deleting tweets.
</p>
<p>
    A few weeks ago, in March 2018, I was clearing out my tweets. I had about 6,500 liked
    tweets to download and un-like. In theory, calls to Twitter's <span class='inlineCode'>GetFavorites</span> API
    support 75 queries of 200 tweets every fifteen minutes, so I could retrieve
    about 60,000 tweets per hour. And yet, when I ran my script, it archived and deleted
    about 3,200 tweets, and then told me there were no more to handle.
</p>
<p>
    I was puzzled. I went on my Twitter profile in the browser, and found that
    there were 3,255 tweets that had not been retrieved.
</p>
	<img width="751px" src="../images/twitter-likes-1.png" style='border: 1px solid black;'></img>
<p>
    I liked another tweet, and tried running my script again. It picked up
    the new tweet and handled it, but couldn't retrieve any favorites after that.
</p>
	<img class='imgcenter' src="../images/twitter-likes-0.png" style='border: 1px solid black;'></img>
<p>
    I assumed that I had hit some kind of hidden rate limit, so I
    decided to check again in a few hours. At that point, I ran my script again, but to no avail. It could delete
    tweets that I had liked in the interim, but the old 3,255 liked tweets,
    which were so clearly visible on my timeline, seemed totally irretrievable by API.
</p>
<p>
    Of course there existed no documentation on this issue. However, digging through the
    <a href='https://twittercommunity.com/t/cant-get-all-favorite-tweets-by-rest-api/22007/3'>Twitter Developer Community</a>,
    I found that the <a href='https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/timelines/api-reference/get-statuses-user_timeline'>GetStatuses API</a> only
    lets you retrieve the most recent 3,200 statuses of a user, and that the list of liked tweets
    is another "timeline" that is likely subject to the same constraints.
    Considering that my script had managed to un-like the first 3,200 and after that couldn't find any more,
    this seemed plausible. I double-checked with a friend who used to work at Twitter,
    who confirmed that 3,200 is the set limit for many timelines, and that the tweets
    that I see remaining on my profile are served from some different data store that is not accessible
    to <span class='inlineCode'>GetFavorites</span>. He advised that I check back in a week to see if that data store
    gets repopulated with my remaining tweets &mdash; I did, but to no avail.
</p>
<p>
    So, with those 3,255 tweets permanently inaccessible through the API,
    I needed a different solution. I realized I could
    browser-scrape all the tweets on my page, and get their IDs so I could un-like them.
    I tried retrieving a tweet by its ID, and then un-liking it directly:
</p>
	<img class='imgcenter' src="../images/twitter-likes-2.png" style='border: 1px solid black;'></img>
    <br/>
    <img class='imgcenter' src="../images/twitter-likes-3.png" style='border: 1px solid black;'></img>
<p>
    So that didn't work. But bizarrely enough, it seemed  I could call
    <span class='inlineCode'>CreateFavorite</span> to like a tweet that I had already liked:
</p>
    <img class='imgcenter' src="../images/twitter-likes-4.png" style='border: 1px solid black;'></img>
<p>
    And this corresponded to an interface change: suddenly
    the like-icon for that tweet was filled in, whereas for other tweets on
    that timeline, they were not.
</p>
    <img class='imgcenter' src="../images/twitter-likes-5.png" style='border: 1px solid black;'></img>
<p>
    It appeared that the list of tweets to display on my likes timeline
    was served from some part of Twitter's system that was totally disconnected
    from the API, and that the logic of whether or not to display a filled-in heart,
    denoting a liked tweet, was dependent on the API. Go figure.
</p>
<p>
    However, now I could make calls to <span class='inlineCode'>DestroyFavorite</span> to unlike that tweet,
    and that would finally remove the tweet from my timeline. We're down from 3,255 to 3,254.
</p>
    <img class='imgcenter' src="../images/twitter-likes-6.png" style='border: 1px solid black;'></img>
    <br/>
    <img class='imgcenter' src="../images/twitter-likes-7.png" style='border: 1px solid black;'></img>
<p>
    In summary:
    calls to <span class='inlineCode'>DestroyFavorite</span> would only work on tweets that were in
    the data store (of at most 3200 tweets)
    accessible to the API, and that liking a tweet would put it
    into that data store, even if it were already in the API-inaccessible data store of
    liked tweets. In turn, if a tweet was in the API-accessible data store, modifying
    that tweet would modify it in the API-inaccessible data store.
    From the point of view of engineering massively scalable systems, this
    makes sense as a design decision, except that it would be nice to repopulate the
    API-accessible data store with tweets from the API-inaccessible data store
    when the former is empty and the latter is not.
</p>
<p>
    Having figured all that out, I then went down my infinite-scroll
    likes timeline, and used browser tools to extract the ids:
    every tweet was of class <span class='inlineCode'>js-stream-item</span> and
    had a <span class='inlineCode'>data-item-id</span> attribute.
</p>
    <img class='imgcenter' src="../images/twitter-likes-8.png" style='border: 1px solid black;'></img>
    <br/>
    <img class='imgcenter' src="../images/twitter-likes-9.png" style='border: 1px solid black;'></img>
<p>
    So, as I loaded the page, I only needed to grab all those IDs...
</p>
    <img class='imgcenter' src="../images/twitter-likes-10.png" style='width: 751px; border: 1px solid black;'></img>
<p>
    ...and feed them to my Python script.
</p>
    <img class='imgcenter' src="../images/twitter-likes-11.png" style='border: 1px solid black;'></img>
    <br/>
    <img class='imgcenter' src="../images/twitter-likes-12.png" style='border: 1px solid black;'></img>
<p>
    Goal accomplished!
</p>
    <img class='imgcenter' src="../images/twitter-likes-13.png" style='width: 751px; border: 1px solid black;'></img>
<p>
    The number of liked tweets at this point is, of course, wrong. Again, this is unsurprising in terms
    of building scalable systems: there's no way Twitter performs a database count every time your profile is loaded;
    that number is likely stored elsewhere and updated (on entirely mysterious conditions). Twitter has a remarkably
    <a href='https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/missing-tweets'>unhelpful help page</a> which
    confirms that this is an issue, but offers no explanation.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, there were some casualties in the course of this adventure. Because my approach
    involved re-liking and then un-liking thousands of tweets, some of the folks I follow
    more closely got <i>a lot</i> of notifications.
</p>

<p>
    I had to answer some questions.
