    Project Euler Problems 1-50
</atitle>
<br><br>

<p>
    When Python 3.6 was released, I was pleased to see my last reservations
    about Python 3 addressed, and appealing improvements to the language,
    in performance as well as in features.
    Thus, I started making the personal switch from 2.7 to 3.6 in January,
    committing to using 3.6 over 2.7 whenever possible, i.e. unless dealing
    with some legacy system or library.
</p>
<p>
    In effort to familiarize myself with Python 3.6&rsquo;s new features and subtle
    differences to 2.7, I decided to revisit the
    <a href="https://projecteuler.net/archives">Project Euler</a> exercises,
    and to do the first fifty. I am sharing my solutions in
    this <a href="https://github.com/datamine/project-euler">GitHub repository</a>. Take a look!
</p>
<p>
    In solving these problems, I noticed that particular kinds of functions
    are required over and over again: for example, lots of Project Euler problems
    require you to generate some prime numbers. I bundled all these re-usable helper
    functions into a small package called <span class="inlineCode">Utilities</span>.
    This package has near-complete test coverage: I added unit tests for
    all included functions except one.

    I also included a script, <span class="inlineCode">confirm-solutions.py</span>,
    that runs all the solutions in a batch. Between this and the test coverage,
    it&rsquo;s very easy to detect when some changes to the helper functions break
    any functionality.
</p>
<p>
    Though I wrote my solutions casually, I tried to use reasonably
    clear variable names and light comments to indicate the <i>reasoning</i>
    behind my solutions. The Project Euler exercises, as far as I&rsquo;m
    familiar with them, are generally not so much
    about writing code to solve problems as they are about finding theoretically
    efficient ways to solve problems, and then implementing them in practice.
    If you&rsquo;re working on the problems yourself, I hope that you may find my
    solutions useful.
